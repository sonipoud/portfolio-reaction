                Welcome to my E-Portfolio! <br />
                My name is Sonika Poudyal and I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree of Bachelors in
                Biology
                Sciences.
                Eventhough, I graduated with a biology major, I never felt accomplished.
                After graduation, I worked in a lab for few years but I never enjoyed it.
                I was always searching for something better and I realized that I wanted to go for a different
                career
                path.
                After struggling for a few years to find my right career path, I finally found one as a Web
                developer.
